USEME:
To use the GUI through the main method just follow these simple steps:
- Run the program from the main method in the image util class
- The GUI should now be open
To use the GUI through the JAR file you can simply just run it and the GUI will automatically open.

To run a script file, the GUI, or the text based controller you can also type in any of the command line
arguments laid out in the assignment.

General Notes for Using the GUI:
- Any mistakes a user makes which cause illegal argument or state exceptions will be caught and displayed as
  pop messages telling the user what they did wrong.
- Be sure to create layers before loading on any images
- If an action is cancelled, a message is shown saying the event was cancelled.

- Removing the layer from this index will also increment all the other layers accordingly such that
  the order of the layer numbers stays consecutive
Make Visible:
- Clicking on this button or selecting this from a drop down menu will prompt the user to input
  the index at which to make the layer visible
Make Invisible:

- If applied when the current is the topmost visible image, the effects should be seen after a brief moment on
  the displayed image
Sharpen:

  any jpeg, jpg, png, or ppm image to be loaded onto the image processing program.
- Note that if there are spaces in the names of the file path of the image, the built in readers of the file
  path will return an error
Load MultiImage:
- Clicking on this in any drop down menu will open the file selector for the user, allowing them to select
  any folder to load into the program.

  just like loading any other image.

  height of the resized multi-image.
